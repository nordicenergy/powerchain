A Blockchain-based Distributed Energy Infrastructure



### Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as blockchain solutions for the energy, automotive industry, system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms.

- A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. ... A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.




### What is PowerChain?

PowerChain is a blockchain-based Distributed Internet Infrastructure. PowerChain blockchain protocol powered by Nordic Energy smart contract, token (NET) and the native cryptocurrency NEC brings speed and scalability to a multi-blockchain architecture that addresses the need for minimal transaction fees and highly security.





### PowerChain - Blockchain Architecture:

PowerChain blockchain allow for the automated execution of smart contracts in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. They can alternatively be seen as databases that permit multiple users to make changes in the ledger simultaneously, which can result in multiple chain versions. Instead of managing the ledger by a single trusted centre, each individual network member holds a copy of the records’ chain and reach an agreement on the valid state of the ledger with consensus.

PowerChain brings speed and scalability to a multi-blockchain architecture that addresses the need for minimal transaction fees and highly security. Nordic Energy´s PowerChain operates as a smart contract platform and decentralized operating system intended for the deployment of industrial-scale decentralized applications through a decentralized autonomous corporation model.



### How it Works?

PowerChain blockchain operates as a smart contract platform and decentralized operating system intended for the deployment of industrial-scale decentralized applications through a decentralized autonomous corporation model.


#### The next-generation blockchain protocol with industry- leading transaction speed and flexible utility based of EOSIO blockchain infrastructure:

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed store of transaction data. Periodically a new block of transactions is created and connected to the previous block. 

- It is distributed because the blockchain stores transactions across many computers. 

- It is decentralized because the blockchain infrastructure is not owned by one company.


#### PowerChain Network gives smart contracts secure access to platform external data, blockchain transactions, and other API capabilities:

- smart contract platform to eliminate transaction fees
- is fully compatible with EOSIO and aims to achieve millions transactions per second
- its delegated proof of stake blockchain
- to easily deploy (partners) business on the PowerChain blockchain



#### Delegated Proof-Of-Stake Consensus Protocol (DPOS):

Our smart contract technologies based delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol. The protocol emulates most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk storage) with the computing resources distributed equally among NET tokens and NEC cryptocurrency holders.
