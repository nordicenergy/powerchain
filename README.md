# Blockchain based Energy Infrastructure


#### Energy & Utilities based of blockchain technology “to revolutionize the global energy market through decentralization and industries".



#### PowerChain

By using Nordic Energy´s cross-platforms makes it possible for distributed energy resource owners to transact in a P2P with consumers. All producers of renewable energy to tap into our marketplace of electricity consumers, producers and prosumers — enabling them to transact with each other directly. Trading on the energy market is a possible way to reduce the electricity costs of consumers, charging electric vehicles at public charging station, which is the platform commercially available to a mass market. Nordic Energy is planning of energy trading, grid-connected electric vehicle charging stations and key technologies. Our platform, any organization can reduce administrative costs, secure operations, develop new services for customers, and more. It can radically transform energy and utilities that have traditionally relied on a centrally controlled and trusted partnership model. Nordic Energy´s cross-platforms enables quick integration with existing IOT solutions for business in a scalable and cost-efficient way.


#### Energy Exchange

Energy exchange platform Is scalable public-private blockchain with deletable data features, made for commercial products, with energy, charging use cases, and co-innovated with SAP. Nordic Energy platforms enable to trade electricity until shortly before the period of delivery on so called intraday electricity markets.

#### Smart Contracts

Our smart contract technology based delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol is capable of fixing issues with the complexity of data from energy sales, storage and sharing. We are on a mission to decentralize energy trading, data management, wholesale electricity distribution by blockchain-based peer-to-peer power supply, IoT and transmitting technologies. Our blockchain-based solutions does not set limits and competition is not created, because it creates communality and where everyone can benefit. Trading electricity or even to create new ones by using blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions that bypass a central utility, retail energy provider and using blockchain to track the production of clean energy.

#### Introduction
We using blockchain-based technology to transform the energy ecosystem, building a business of the new energy generation. Nordic Energy´s infrastructure includes the traditional utilities associated with peer-to-peer energy trading, transport, management, supply-chains and administrative functions.
</p>


#### Protocol
A Blockchain-based of EOSIO technology “to revolutionize the global energy market through decentralization and energy industries". protocol powered by Nordic Energy smart contracts, and the native cryptocurrency PowerChain (PWRC). PowerChain (blockchain) network brings speed and scalability to a PowerChain blockchain architecture that addresses the need for minimal transaction fees and highly security. Nordic Energy´s blockchain-enabled transactional digital platform offer operational cost reductions, increased efficiency, fast and automated processes, transparency and the possibility of reducing capital requirements for company. Nordic Energy smart contract technologies based delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol. 
</p>


#### PowerChain´s gives smart contracts secure access to platform external data, blockchain transactions, and other API capabilities:

1. energy smart contract platform to eliminate transaction fees
2. is fully compatible with EOSIO and aims to achieve millions transactions per second
3. it´s delegated proof of stake blockchain 
4. to easily deploy (partners) business network on the Nordic Energy´s PowerChain blockchain.

### Ecosystem


#### NET token is utility token of Nordic Energy ecosystem

Nordic Energy platform enables for creating, electricity trading, digital assets. Nordic Energy connects energy buyers (end-users and investors) directly with green energy producers and creates an opportunity to purchase electricity upfront at or below market rates. To become the leading distributor for blockchain innovation, P2P energy trading platform and entrepreneurship in sustainable energy. Is use blockchain to reduce the easy supplier integration services scheme will cut the time and costs of processing orders, as well as increasing reliability and integrating better with customers’ own (clean) electricity generating systems, technology, using the platform to authenticate the provenance of 100% clean energy, energy efficiency products and bringing a new level of multi-layered electricity distribution to the energy industry.
</p>


### Applications (dApp)
Blockchain applications in the energy sector and state that blockchain-enabled platform can facilitate financial transactions between different financial institutions and make payments faster by speeding up confirmation times. The main use of smart contracts process of issuing ownership rights to real-world assets or utility in the form of a cryptocurrency. It helps energy producer, supplier, EVs charging point operators and  service providers ability to customize token and smart contracts with advanced features.
</p>


### Energy Trading
Nordic Energy is developing the scalable public-private blockchain platform with deletable data features, made for commercial products. Platform is designed with energy exchange, electic vehicle charging solutions for commercial use case.
</p>


### Decentralized Energy Market
Decentralized energy market based of Ethereum blockchain
</p>


### Development
</p>


## Our Mission
We hope to power an increased investment in green energy, power energy provenance certificates to verify green energy origins, and create a paradigm for decentralized energy grid management. The NET token aim to simplify our life, ordering process, settlements with energy smart contracts, facilitate payments, automate billing processes. We also believe the best innovation and biggest progress comes from opening our doors to the community, which is why we are dedicated to education and open-source development within the next energy generation to create an autonomous transactions that helps renewable energy prosumers to exchange energy in a more democratic system, and to create new community-driven energy models that embrace green energy initiatives.
